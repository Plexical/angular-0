# angular-0

# Installation instructions:

First, install Gulp with `npm install gulp -g`. It's necessary for Semantic UI to build.

Then, `cd` to main repository folder and type: `npm install` (some node-gyp errors can show up when installing Angular 2.0, but that's normal apparently). Confirm all default settings during Semantic UI install.

Go to Semantic UI folder with `cd semantic` and execute `gulp build`.

# Running instructions:

In the main repository folder, type `npm run lite` once installation is over. The app will start on `http://localhost:3000`.
